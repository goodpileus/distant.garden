        Dear Saki,<br>
        I hope this text finds you well. Thank you for your enthusiasm to engage us through this additional format. We are still very excited about the possibility of a future visit to campus. I personally was so excited about the timing of it all.
        Zimbabwe celebrates it‚Äôs 40th year as an independent nation, your own birthday and ZIVA‚Äôs 20th anniversary feels like an incredibly charged triangulation.
        <br><br>
        Instead of trying to simulate the experience of a lecture and because we all need a bit more levity and reflection during this time we‚Äôd recalibrated and opted for a format that is more causal and conversational. I‚Äôve been wanting to
        introduce
        you and Chino Amobi, a former graduate of our program at VCU and now a member of our faculty. I‚Äôll hand over to you Chino to continue the conversation with Saki. There are so many amazing connections between your interests and trajectories
        and
        I‚Äôm hoping some of these will be teased out here in this conversation.
        <br><br>
        I‚Äôll leave you with a video clip that I intended to play at the beginning of the lecture. Please feel free to attach your own links, images and sound to this thread. We are setting up to accommodate a range of media. So looking forward to
        transcribing and publishing this.
        <br><br>
        Best

        Hi Nontsi, Chino<br>
        So excited to be doing this here! This video... bittersweet! Chinua Achebe called it! His ‚ÄúThings Fall Apart‚Äù very prophetic for Zimbabwe (and many other Afrikan countries). ‚ÄúCry the Beloved Country‚Äù and George Orwell‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnimal Farm‚Äù! How,
        why
        and WHERE did it all go wrong for us?

        Hey everyone, good to meet you Saki. This video is so powerful I remember seeing footage of this show in a Bob Marley documentary about his life. It‚Äôs so wild to see the hope on people‚Äôs faces at that show and to think about how the energy
        must have felt.

        I had left Zimbabwe two years before so I missed the show. I was in university at Indiana, Bloomington where we created our own magic on that day. I did all the flyers for the Independence Day party, Zimbabwe‚Äôs FIRST ever! There was so much
        HOPE everywhere, hope that Zimbabwe would become a success story. So many people around the world had supported our struggle for independence, so many people within and outside the country had sacrificed their lives... so the euphoric faces
        you see in the video... they carried the hopes of a nation. Bob Marley provided the soundtrack for that hope.

        I was a huge Reggae fan and so I listened to a LOT of Reggae! I also saw a lot of live Reggae music around that time... until a girlfriend born in Indianapolis of a Nigerian father and an Afrikan American mother introduced me to FELA!!! Wow!
        First I loved the album covers... it was like, ‚ÄúAfrikan graphic design!!!‚Äù Tanya was great and we shared a love for all types of music... very eclectic! We were into Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Ella... we drove to Indy for a Count Bassie
        show and saw Muddy Waters live at a Bloomington club!

        Let me just say here that Bloomington was an oasis in a conservative and racist state. IU, Bloomington was a college town, not really part of Indiana! So musically, a lot of amazing stuff happened! The Rolling Stones did a surprise concert
        there... fantastic stuff like that was not unusual. I saw a killer Toots and the Maytals show there along with Chicago Blues stalwarts like Koko Taylor, Luther Allison who were staples at The Bluebird night club.

        I know I glossed over seeing Muddy Waters live at Jakes Nighclub but it was HUGE! It was predominantly a white student audience so when it was over, I rushed backstage and Muddy who was surrounded by admirers made eye contact and pushed
        through the crowd and extended his hand, I shook it and mumbled something about an amazing show! As we walked into the summer night, I said, "Muddy Waters shook my hand, I‚Äôm not gonna wash it!‚Äù Remains one of those memories in my life! OMG

        1987, I was moonlighting as a writer for this Zim/UK magazine called, "Black Beat International". They wanted me to cover mainly Reggae since that was the music happening in Zim post independence... Bob Marley planted the seed... So I called
        my column "Big Apple Runnings" since I lived in NYC. So, although I wasn't doing any Jazz stuff for them, I used my credentials to get into the 1987 JVC Jazz Festival at Lincoln Center. The PR guy took a liking to me and he invited me to a
        "very exclusive and special show" at one of the Carnegie Hall recital halls. So, I went there very excited and discovered I was one of about a dozen writers. The guy told us that Sun Ra was going to give us a piano recital, solo. OMG,
        anyway, I think each and every one of us tried our best to be blas√©... We took our seats, pads and pen in hand. The Oracle came in draped in majestic robes, nodded and sat down by the grand piano. He paused for a minute in a silent prayer,
        then he started to play... splashing notes a la Jackson Pollock is more like it! He got in the zone and enthralled us for a full 20 minutes, stopped, took a bow and walked out as silently as he had come. That was it. I had witnessed the man
        from Space do his thing, a special thing... I still feel the hairs on my skin stand to this day!

        The icing on the cake was Miles Davis and his band who played during the same festival. I smuggled a tape recorder so I was able to record a bootleg of the performance. I have that tape somewhere... good hoarder but very lousy archiver.

        Man... that literally sounds like something out of a movie. Someone needs to make a movie/documentary about all your experiences interspliced with your archive. The way you described it all brought it to life right in front of me low key
        felt like I was there. I can just see him just walking out like straight up hovering out of the room after playing. It‚Äôs also wild to think about how extreme the personalities were back then. Sun Ra and Miles. Straight up larger than life
        not only in there music but in their style and countenance. Like we legit don‚Äôt even have a category for this anymore

        Well, since we're in Mali, I have to introduce you to my favorite female singer of all time: Rokia Traore. She plays a huge Rickenbacker guitar but it's her voice that has captivated me. Rokia is from a wealthy family ‚Äì the father's a
        diplomat and she could have chosen another path, but she chose music ‚Äì the traditional music of Mali. Her voice is bewitching, other worldly and angelic even but that omnipresent Malian sound is what gets you . A REAL treat for the soul.
        Check her out here with a traditional ensemble, and if you love Bob Marley check out her "Afrika Unite" at 6.30:

        So, this wasn't a Top 20 of my favotite Afrikan album covers, that's Mission Impossible for Afrika. These are my favorites the ones I could find. There's a lot more from Afrika that's difficult to find. And the mixes, I don't have any. I
        stopped making mixes in the 90s and not easy to lay one's hands on mixes on the continent.

        I think a good place to bring it full circle would be to ask you, in relation to Bob Marleys concert in Zimbabwe, what you think the future of African music and design will be like in relation to freedom and liberation

        Hello Saki and Chino, this has been an incredible engagement so far. We are hoping to wrap up the published part of this conversation for the sake of our process. At the end of tomorrow we will download the content and begin formatting. I am
        sure you can ge tot a great wrapping up point by then and already feels like you are naturally getting to that place. I hope your conversations will continue past this point too!
        <br><br>
        Very much looking forward to sharing this phenomenal content. It is encyclopedic!

        Oops, I always hit "Return" and it posts the message before I'm done! So let's try this again.<br><br>
        So, Bob Marley's lyrics brought hope to a battle-weary people who had endured a brutal and bloody six-year civil war. A lot of lives had been lost but in the end, People Power triumphed! Fast forward 40 years later, Zimbabwe is a failed
        state, destroyed by the scourge of CORRUPTION and GREED. Afrikan music has endured and at this very moment, Nigerian Pop is poised to take over the continent and hopefully, the world. Afrikan music will be alright, mostly because it is
        always willing to look outside and to allow those influences to seep into its DNA. Design too is on the move. Afrikan fashion has always been an influence on the global fashion scene. We've seen Afrikan models like Iman become megastars on
        the Fashion scene. Afrikan styles have been ripped off on the global Fashion scene but we're now seeing fashion designers from the continent making waves and strides internationally. Architecture is also at a good spot, as foreign trained
        Architects are returning home to change the scene at home. Afrika could become a mover and a shaker in that field. Graphic Design has been the last hold-out but with the recent formation of PADI ‚Äì The Pan Afrikan Design Institute based in
        Ghana, all that might change. This is the first such initiative and if the numbers of designers (multidisciplinary) joining the initiative are anything to go by, then the future of DESIGN in Afrika is very bright indeed. I am at a place
        where I'm feeling quite hopeful.<br><br>
        All these hopeful feelings are marred by our leadership, though. Afrika's leaders continent wide are all guilty of the scourge of corruption and greed. It seems like people get into politics so that they can LOOT as much as possible for
        themselves, their families and cronies. This is one scourge that we have no idea how to handle. I ran ZIVA for twenty years without any funding, not from outside or from within. The government let me do my thing without any assistance and
        the outside world blamed the politics of my country for their refusal to help with funding. We all know that a school needs funding to grow. We were on our own for twenty years. If that ain't a miracle, then I don't know what that word
        means.<br><br>
        In conclusion, I think that it's the Pan Afrikan spirit that will grow music and design in Afrika. It seems like that spirit's gaining ground and traction and that gives me reason to smile. It's like the ARTISTS will liberate Afrika. The
        politicians brought political "independence" and that was a good thing, great even. "Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds..." That timeless message from the eternal Bob Marley is a good place to
        end this amazing conversation I've enjoyed and had the honor and joy to engage in with my young blood Chino! üëäüèøüëäüèøüëäüèø
