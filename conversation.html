        Dear Saki,<br>
        I hope this text finds you well. Thank you for your enthusiasm to engage us through this additional format. We are still very excited about the possibility of a future visit to campus. I personally was so excited about the timing of it all.
        Zimbabwe celebrates it’s 40th year as an independent nation, your own birthday and ZIVA’s 20th anniversary feels like an incredibly charged triangulation.
        <br><br>
        Instead of trying to simulate the experience of a lecture and because we all need a bit more levity and reflection during this time we’d recalibrated and opted for a format that is more causal and conversational. I’ve been wanting to
        introduce
        you and Chino Amobi, a former graduate of our program at VCU and now a member of our faculty. I’ll hand over to you Chino to continue the conversation with Saki. There are so many amazing connections between your interests and trajectories
        and
        I’m hoping some of these will be teased out here in this conversation.
        <br><br>
        I’ll leave you with a video clip that I intended to play at the beginning of the lecture. Please feel free to attach your own links, images and sound to this thread. We are setting up to accommodate a range of media. So looking forward to
        transcribing and publishing this.
        <br><br>
        Best
        <br><br>

        Hi Nontsi, Chino<br>
        So excited to be doing this here! This video... bittersweet! Chinua Achebe called it! His “Things Fall Apart” very prophetic for Zimbabwe (and many other Afrikan countries). “Cry the Beloved Country” and George Orwell’s “Animal Farm”! How,
        why
        and WHERE did it all go wrong for us?

        Hey everyone, good to meet you Saki. This video is so powerful I remember seeing footage of this show in a Bob Marley documentary about his life. It’s so wild to see the hope on people’s faces at that show and to think about how the energy
        must have felt.

        I had left Zimbabwe two years before so I missed the show. I was in university at Indiana, Bloomington where we created our own magic on that day. I did all the flyers for the Independence Day party, Zimbabwe’s FIRST ever! There was so much HOPE everywhere, hope that Zimbabwe would become a success story. So many people around the world had supported our struggle for independence, so many people within and outside the country had sacrificed their lives... so the euphoric faces you see in the video... they carried the hopes of a nation. Bob Marley provided the soundtrack for that hope.
