          Working in collaboration with her class of graduate students at Yale School of Art, Laurel Schwulst initiated the online publication, The Life and Death of an Internet Onion. What began as a class project over a year ago, seems so timely
          and potent as we all move through our experiences of time and feeling all whilst engaging and navigating the space of the internet and other digital tools.

          Laurelâ€™s practice brings us to ourselves what interfaces have to do with reading and writing. We are excited to support this work and learn more about this project and look forward to engaging the content online and Laurel in person in
          weeks to come.

        Laurel is working on publishing an online anthology of writings about expressing love online. The project, colloquially titled "internet onion," was originally created in her "Interactive Design" class at Yale during the Spring 2019 semester. 17 students in the class responded to the following prompt:
        <br><br>
        In her piece "A Drop of Love in the Cloud," (2018) artist Fei Liu writes about the like/heart button as a flattening affordance of giving affirmation and love. The text-editor provides a much more expressive input. But even people who can't communicate well because of language barriers can express love through actions, like cooking food. Can we create other "love inputs" that might allow us to "reach across the chasm of a seamless signal"? What is expressing "real" love or affirmation about? Is it about effort, thoughtfulness, generosity, something else? What might a thoughtful or generous interface feel or behave like?
        <br><br>
        The project was co-edited by Are.na's Meg Miller and facilitated by teaching assistant Willis Kingery. Full participant names to follow.
